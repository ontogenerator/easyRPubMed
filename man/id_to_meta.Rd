\title{Extract Data from a Vector of Records}
\usage{
id_to_meta(ids, api_key = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{Vector including one or more DOIs or PMIDs.}

\item{max_chars}{Numeric (integer). Maximum number of characters to be extracted from
the Article Abstract field. Set max_chars to -1 for extracting the full-length abstract.
Set max_chars to 0 to extract no abstract.}

\item{get_authors}{Logical. If FALSE, author information won't be extracted. This will considerably 
speed up the operation.}

\item{get_keywords}{Logical. If TRUE, an attempt to extract article Keywords will be made.}

\item{api_key}{String (character vector of length 1): user-specific API key to increase 
the limit of queries per second. You can obtain your key from NCBI.}
}
\value{
Data frame including the extracted features. Each row corresponds to a different entry from the input vector.
}
\description{
Extract publication-specific information from a vector of DOIs or PMIDs. 
The input records are given as a character-class vector.
Data are returned as a data frame where each row corresponds 
to a single record. All records are assumed to be of the same type, either DOI or PMID.
}
\details{
For each Pubmed Article record, this function will automatically extract a set of features. 
Extracted information include: PMID, DOI, article title, article abstract, publication date (year, month, day), 
publication type, journal name (title, abbreviation), and ISSN.
